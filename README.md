Overview

This is a Next.js web app project that replicates Intercom's AI-powered admin panel UI and behavior, as seen in the given demo video.
The goal was to provide a responsive, user-centric, and visually appealing admin panel that is similar to Intercom's UI/UX design,
with modern UI/UX practices, silky transitions, and clean code. The app was built using Next.js, Tailwind CSS,
and Framer Motion to present a scalable and maintainable codebase.

Features

Dashboard Structure
The structure is inspired by Intercom's minimalist admin panel UI. It features a sidebar for navigation, a header with user controls,
and a content area for showing content or data.

AI Chat Interface
There's a chat area that copies Intercom's bot chat UI. It features message bubbles, a scrollable conversation area,
and an input field, all filled with dummy data.

Responsive Design
The design scales neatly between desktop, tablet, and mobile screens. Additionally,
it accommodates touch on smaller screens.

Animations
Framer Motion is employed to define smooth animations and transitionsâ€”such as when closing the sidebar or opening modals.
This makes the interface dynamic and refined.
